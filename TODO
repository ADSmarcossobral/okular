TODO - okular
Legend:
    ADD - ADDed (new feature)
    CHG - CHanGed (existing behavior)
    FIX - FIXed (bug or regression)
    MRG - MeRGed (code from a branch or a patch)

In progress [working on]:
-> toc: highlight the row of the current page (BR127358)
   (check if there's a better way to do the highlighting - in case just edit TOCItem::setSelected())
-> thumbnailslist: show Viewport in(blended/contour)
   (actually it's only a red contour)
-> annotations: renderers in PagePainter (for the 6 annots)
-> annotations: handlers in PageView for WindowAnnots and others..
-> annotations: creators in PageViewAnnotator (40% done)
-> annotations: framework (BR67300,BR62793) and tools (BR67300,BR91251)
-> annotations: add the annot pane (cool plz!)
-> link: add a KPDFAnchor link class
-> (done: 100%) refactor, pdf parser, xml storage
-> check mouse wrapping not screH / 2
-> check if fix was applied in head only (pageview.cpp 1676)
-> pageview: update layout when toggling the 'ebook atyle alignment'

More items (first items will enter 'In progress list' first):
-> pageview: add vp damaging queue and flush function. add coolfx to smoothmove using damaging
-> annotations: add config option for default name change
-> annotations: toolbar: display tooltip only the first time
-> annotations: provide nice wizards. Make it easy to deliver/copy/move the xml files (by Uga)
-> GHNS: get hot new ebooks on the supported formats (pdf for now) (enrico)
-> popup context menu when using right button in selection mode (BR99315)
-> pageview: add scrollbar marks for bookmarks (like kate)
-> evaluate changing KPDFLink to KPDFAction
-> evaluate changing KPDFLinkMovie to KPDFLinkResource (any kind)
-> evaluate completely handling links internally instead of asking xpdf structs
-> pageview: change document viewport after mouse scrolling ended (not every scroll frame)
   this will give better mvc consistancy
-> other info on pdfs properties: number of accessed times, time spent on pdf, ...
-> part: collapsing the left panel will hide it (activate hiding action)
-> preload: add a delay when forward loading pages
-> bookmarks: fastmarks (new bookmark concept with tab-like signs, shortcuts, etc) (BR
-> viewport restoring: sometimes it seems to restore the viewport a bit under where it was
-> viewport restoring: save the zoom/viewCols/continuous setting between runs (BR97307+patch)
-> core: Delay TOC (DocumentSynopsis) generation (and move it on thread)
-> core: add a way to handle "named xpdf links" in KPDFLink instead of resolving all
   dests when displaying a page (speedups a lot generation of page with many links)
-> toolbar: move the toolbar to the top of pageview (left panel is really at the left of the toolbar)
-> thumbnailslist: refactor to do internal rendering as pageview does (way faster
   than using QScrollArea + inserted Widgets and saves 8% on document loading)
-> thumbnailslist: clinking on highlighted rect should bring the viewport to that search result (BR98334)
-> Dom framework to cache document metadata. It should archive those types of data:
   (NOTE: already Dom'ed object is marked with 'X')
   - <X> Synopsis will go there after 1st generation (so we can edit it too)
   - <X> Document info (after the 1st gen)
   - <X> Bookmarked pages
   - <X> Current Viewport and 10 history steps
   - Edited pages (rotated/with_data for example)
   - Overlay editing (highlighting/notations/etc..)
   - Presentation related overrides (FS mode, individual / global transitions)
   - ..more stuff.. but this isn't a problem, since a QDom is flexible by design
   The Object will reside into the Document and must not be accessible by Observers in
   a direct way. Dom format, relations to other classes and accessing must be specified
   in a separated diagram or text file.
   - Plus think at storing xml data to an external shared server.. something that
   has to do with versioning data.. (shared annotations, bookmarks & co.)
-> add kpdf manual in PDF format loaded on the first startup or on menu->help->manual
   this visually explains basic usage, mouse buttons functions & more..
-> ADD: click over image allows "save image" [60% done (activerect of type image)]
-> text selection in wordprocessor style (very hard, not impossible)
-> zoom: fit text (with configurable margin)
-> bookview: 3d opengl widget for viewing the document as a real book (turning pages, etc..)
-> wallet: use asynchronous interface (to prevent ui-blocking)
-> open gzipped (.pdf.gz?) files
-> restore a location from a given url (like http:/someurl?stringForViewport) (BR99240)
-> kspeech TTS interface. speech {document(missing) / page(missing) / selection(done)}
-> automatic online dictionaries / translators (BR80338)
-> core: pdf forms support (BR91809)
-> evaluate wether to add find icon to the toolbar. poll/usab? (BR92620)
-> sidebar: evaluate wether to make the left toolbox auto-hiding (kicker like) (BR94495)
-> add OCR for building TextPages out of pure graphical (aka scanned) pages
-> rotate the whole document / individual pages (on screen/print?) (BR99352)
   Have a look at the fifth parameter of displayPage, it is the rotation, so it should not be THAT hard to implement
-> presentation: add page counter and a widget to manually set pages on the top bar
-> presentation: provide a pageX/totalPages indicator in addition to the circle one
-> presentation: implement missing transitions (6/11 done)
-> presentation: add a red pencil that creates ink annotations (author: i18n(author-presentation)))
-> presentation: save a flag (to the xml) to open a pdf in presentation mode
-> presentation: wheel not visible on black. gradient appreciated on lighter backgrounds.
-> presentation: 2 pages per view, for users reading ebooks with wide screens.
-> splash(xpdf): check lack of smoothness at low resolutions and antialiasing (BR94231)
-> goto 'logical' page (usually differs from pdf's page) (req. by Luca Burrelli)
-> move some document related features from part to the document (see find, goto dialog, ...)
-> Albert: Read pdf specification and see if paths with length = 1 are allowed, in case they are allowed see how to fix 97131 without skipping paths with length = 1
-> tools: ruler, measure: distance, perimeter, ?area?, color picker
-> export: export to other formats keeping formatting (PS is easy, we just have PSOutputDev that does it :-D. PNG is easy too)
-> export: extract images (have a look at ImageOutputDev.cc and pdfimages.cc from xpdf (not in our xpdf sources))
-> history as a toolbox child (collecting Doc's viewport changes notifications)
-> take care of TODOs in code
-> cleanup code and update README.png

Icons needed:
- KPDF (ToolBAR): 1 continuous, 2 tied-pages, 3 Normal (not scroll only, it
    performs other ops), 4 Zoom, 5 Select, 6 Annotation/Review
- KPDF (Edit Tools): highlighter( transp base, we colorize it)
- COMMON (here in ToolBox): Toc, Annotations
