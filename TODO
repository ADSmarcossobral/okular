ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT

o Re-Implement PostScript specials, including proper handling of header (="bang")
  specials.

o Proper Error handling with throw/catch

o Update the Manual.

o Document the technical specs.

o Bugfixing


HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Support for Hyperlatex specials (xxx.lanl.gov, probably the world's largest
  collection of dvi-files, uses Hyperlatex for every file!)

o Support for TPic and colored font specials

o Support for click-on-dvi => editor (klyx!) jumps to proper position. This is
  included in the windows distribution of TeX. We should really catch up!

o Support papersize informational given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.


NOT SO URGENT

o Document info dialog
o Better online help
o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Redirect error messages to a window (partly done)
o More background processing to keep the UI responsive
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o Popup-Window to inform the user when Fonts are generated
o Search option
