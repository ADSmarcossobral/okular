ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT

o implement SaveAs

o Fonts should be free when file is reloaded and the fonts are no longer needed

o Optionrequester: changes (e.g. PostScript on/off) are not applied until restart of the program.

o Optionrequester: Hypertext on/off, Warnings on/off

o Proper Error handling with throw/catch

o Update the Manual.

o Document the technical specs.

o Bugfixing

o psgs should use and remove tmp-files

o kvieshell should change pageno when clicking on internal hyperlinks


HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Speedup, in particular for ghostscript.

o Support for TPic and colored font specials

o Support for click-on-dvi => editor (klyx!) jumps to proper position. This is
  included in the windows distribution of TeX. We should really catch up!

o Support papersize information given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.


NOT SO URGENT

o Document info dialog
o Better online help
o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Redirect error messages to a window (partly done)
o More background processing to keep the UI responsive
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o Popup-Window to inform the user when Fonts are generated
o Search option
o dynamical storage allocation for hyperlinks (see dviwin.h)
