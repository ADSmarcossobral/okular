TODO - branch version
Legend:
    ADD - ADDed
    CHG - CHanGed
    FIX - FIXed
    MRG - MeRGed from head
    (*) - Some parts of this item are already done

In progress:
-> gen / mem: sync Memory Management (in Document) with the Generator, so
   generators can be notified when cancelling jobs (use the notification signal
   from generator) -> real cleaning
-> gen / mem: check for removing 'canUnloadPixmap' from observers in place of requesting a
   list of visible pixmaps. Think at adding visible list to ObserverData and
   passing the visible list from observers (to remove visi lists)

Urgent fixes and items to get ready before 3.4 (special high-priority list):
-> gen / mem: priorities for requests (pageview, thumbnails, pv preloading, th preloading)
-> mem: check for running request in thread too
-> mem: iterate from older pages to newest ones when freeing memory (not rand)
-> generator: add preloading
-> new word highlighting for searches / other highlights (on paper - enrico)
-> cleanup code and update README.png


More items (first items will enter 'In progress list' first):
-> show Viewport in ThumbnailsList (blended/contour)
-> Delay TOC (DocumentSynapsis) generation (and move it on thread)
-> refactor ThumbnailsList to do internal rendering as pageview does (way
   faster than using QScrollView + inserted Widgets and saves 8% on document
   loading)
-> move toolbar view actions in the PageView instead of the part. maybe.. or not...
-> usability: layout 2PPV [1 2,3 4,5 6] -> [1,2 3,4 5]. add option for 'ebook' style alignment. (by Mikolaj)
-> usability: trigger redraw on 'filter text' on current page (by Mikolaj)
-> display current page / total pages (with analog indicator too (progressbar/...))
   maybe this can be done on a small widget at the top of the toolbox, displaying
   'document' informations (pages, current pg, some metadata, etc..).
   Tested a 16px ktoolbar in the left-bottom corner.. looks goos and can be used to
   insert some actions that aren't so useful in the main (and bigger) toolbar
-> abstract TextPage generation (the last xpdf dependant class!). then go dancing in the
   streets.
-> better boomark rendering (tested a 'clip overlay' but looks bad actually)
   maybe gray out other pages?
-> Dom framework to cache document metadata. It should archive those types of data:
   (NOTE: already Dom'ed object is marked with 'X')
   - <X> Synopsis will go there after 1st generation (so we can edit it too)
   - <X> Document info (after the 1st gen)
   - <X> Bookmarked pages
   - <X - only for viewport> General info (like viewport state)
   - Edited pages (rotated/with_data for example)
   - Overlay editing (hilighting/notations/etc..)
   - Presentation related overrides (FS mode, individual / global transitions)
   - ..more stuff.. but this isn't a problem, since a QDom is flexible by design
   The Object will reside into the Document and must not be accessible by Oservers in
   a direct way. Dom format, relations to other classes and accessing must be specified
   in a separated diagram or text file.
-> right click and drag while in 'scroll' mode changes to 'selection' mode and selects
-> add kpdf manual in PDF format loaded on the first startup or on menu->help->manual
   this visually explains basic usage, mouse buttons functions & more..
-> take care of TODOs in code
-> ADD: click over image allows "save image" [60% done (activerect of type image)]
-> screen editing (annotations): framework (BR67300,BR62793)
-> screen editing (annotations): tools (BR67300)
-> export all text in plain_text/html
-> extract(export?) images (have a look at ImageOutputDev.cc and pdfimages.cc from xpdf (not in our xpdf sources))
-> text selection in wordprocessor style (very hard/impossible)
-> implement history (mainly for actionNamed)
-> history as a toolbox child (collecting Doc's viewport changes notifications)
-> zoom: fit text (with configurable margin)
-> open gzipped (.pdf.gz?) files
-> kttsd output with menu entries. speech{document/page/selection}. (patch available - enrico)
-> kttsd alternative (1): autodetect "/dev/speech" (speechd/festival) and provide reading
-> automatic online dictionaries / translators (BR80338)
-> add OCR for building TextPages out of pure graphical (aka scanned) pages
-> rotate the whole document / individual pages
-> presentation: implement transitions (6/11 done)
-> presentation: add some gfx tools (like a red pencil)
-> presentation: save a flag (to the xml) to open a pdf in presentation mode
-> presentation: link following (difficult due to pagerects related to pageview pixmap only)
-> presentation: wheel not visible on black. gradient appreciated on lighter backgrounds.
-> investigate 'Splash' lack of smoothness at low resolutions (see lines in thumbnails)
-> add search on the toc widget (a prune on type lineedit like in thumbnails widget)
-> goto 'logical' page (usually differs from pdf's page) (req. by Luca Burrelli)
-> use wallet for storing passwords of encrypted files
-> use shortcuts for next and prev page even in presenatation mode (by Tobias Koenig)
-> move some document related features from part to the document (see find, goto dialog, ...)

Done (newest features come first):
-> type ahead search in pageview (type '/' then the word to search..)
-> FIX: scroll page if the the searched string is not visible
-> FIX: use a global Viewport over the document (linked views, real link following, location restoring, etc)
-> FIX: wrong zoom buttons order (BR74248) (check consistancy with kdvi/kviewshell/kghostview/.. (not konq))
-> ADD: presentation: cursor modes: hidden, visible, hidden with delay (Tobias)
-> ADD: presentation: default transition which is used when no transition is defined in document (Tobias)
-> ADD: presentation: support for automatic advance and loop on last page (Tobias)
-> ADD: presentation: add additional presentation page to settings dialog (Tobias)
-> CHG: presentation: the round wheel indicator can be clicked to change page

-> ADD: restore the last active page when a file is opened again
-> ADD: Save bookmarks into a file so you they get recovered when opening the same file again (Albert)
-> FIX: searchline back to work
-> CHG: DocumentInfo is now a DomTree and the properties dialog is dynamically generated (Tobias)

-> Merged on HEAD on 2005-01-02 (The branch is frozen, development continues here)
-> FIX: Fix my update cursor FIX :-D
-> ADD: Make kpdf aware of Find and GoToPage actions
-> FIX: Update cursor correctly when a link moves to a page and the cursor is over a link on that page
-> ADD: Asyncronous PDF Generator implementation (for the user: faster UI, preloading, etc..)
-> FIX: Memory manager (free cache if needed, avoid disk swap and oom)
-> ADD: Presentation View (only the 'glitter' transition implemented for now)
-> FIX: FixPack1 [dyn_zoom repaints, initial panel width, zoom_lineedit focus proxy, searchwidget refactor{thumbs restoring on clear, buttons size, less code}, hilight bookmarked thumbnails]
-> FIX: Some fullScreen loving, if we are on fullscreen put an action on RMB menu ti get out of it, if we were on fullScreen mode on exit bring back correctly if we were also seeing toolbar or menubar
-> FIX: When in non continous mode and scrolling up a page, set the viewport at the bottom of the page (Albert)

-> MRG: Replace xpdf version with lastest one (3.00) that supports PDF 1.5 (Albert)

Here comes a list of suggestions from a dot post http://dot.kde.org/1095261317 and IRC:
 Tool: ruler, measure: distance, perimeter, ?area?
 Tool: color picker
 Annotations: yellow notes 'post-it' like
 Export: export to other formats keeping formatting (a dream.. except for PNG :-)
 PDF: <theICEBear> pdf forms support.... :D if at all possible
