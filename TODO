ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT / URGENT BUGFIXING

o Infrequent crashes when resizing the window or the view (probably related to kviewshell)
o Add menu-item for re-enabeling warnings (should be done in kviewshell, item should appear only 
  if at least some items are switched off)
o Proper handling of the base-url
o give source-information in the status line

HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Speedup, in particular for ghostscript and glyph enlarging.

o Support for colored font specials

o Support papersize information given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.

o Extra enlargement of characters for improved readability should be switchable.


NOT SO URGENT

o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o Search option
o dynamical storage allocation for hyperlinks (see dviwin.h)
o more robust Error handling with throw/catch; no need to abort just because a PK-file is bad.
