ToDo-List for kdvi

URGENT / URGENT BUGFIXING

o Proper handling of the base-url
o don't show REFERENCES, URLS in the title bar
o don't show temporary file names in the titlebar
o add "tt.dvi.gz" to the list of recent files, not "/tmp/kviews....."

HIGHLY DESIRABLE

o Speedup, in particular for ghostscript and glyph enlarging.

o Support for colored font specials

o Support papersize information given by the dvi-file on a page-by-page
  basis.

o Extra enlargement of characters for improved readability should be switchable.


NOT SO URGENT

o Internal printing using QPrinter
o Magnifier window
o Two page view
o Support for even more TeX specials
o more robust Error handling with throw/catch; no need to abort just because a PK-file is bad.
