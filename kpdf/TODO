Personal Albert's list
-> make links functional (done in HEAD)

More items
-> new icons (contest at kde-look that will end in 2004-Oct-01)
-> screen editing (annotations): framework (BR67300,BR62793)
-> screen editing (annotations): tools (BR67300)
-> export all text in plain_text/html
-> extract(export?) images
-> implement history (mainly for actionNamed)
-> zoom: fit text (with configurable margin)
-> automatic online dictionaries / translators (BR80338)
-> session support: restoring page location (BR82589)
-> nice label box to the top to display messages to user (for example session restoring,etc..)
-> wrong zoom buttons order (BR74248) (check consistancy with kdvi/kghostview/.. (not konq))

Porting / In progress on the branch (first item comes first):
-> continous mode (BR74435)
-> multiple pages per view (BR80164)
-> zoom buttons in sync with text (BR69092)
-> porting Albert's link following
-> implementing async document generator using Albert's thread as the generation thread
-> reading aids (accessibility): mode: normal, invert, contrast, recolor bg/text

Done (sorted by inv.time)
-> added the option to open password protected files (from head)
-> added the TOC from head (missing click and go functionality because it needs link following)
-> added a 'search bar' with prune-as-you-type feature
-> ported Albert's search and implemented case sensitive
-> smart handling of pixmap using an Observer ID (thumbnails are gone, only pixmaps now)
-> some toolbar/menu changes
-> outline bottom and right edges (of pages)
-> centering pages in the view
-> kpdf output at 100% has exactly the same size as acroread now
-> qsplitter layouting
-> zooming works as expected (and added 'fit to page' too)
-> new go to page dialog
-> previews sorted by visible areas (prioritize items where the scrollbar is)
-> previews speedup: 50-100%
-> use local instead of X memory for thumbnails (..)
-> merge lots of kpdf_part and part (centralview) code (to simplify/clenup)

Here comes a list of suggestions from a dot post http://dot.kde.org/1095261317 and IRC:
 copy text from rectangular blocks
 text copy/selection in wordprocessor-style
 ruler
 distance measure tool
 color picker
 annotations 'postit' like
 hyperlinks (albert's work needs to be forward ported)
 integration with a voice synthesizer
 export in other formats keeping formatting (a dream.. expect for PNG :-)
 <theICEBear> pdf forms support.... :D if at all possible

Bugs to close after merging to HEAD
BR88661: (thumbnail prev. is blocking) Not only it's threaded, but it generates
         thumbnails only for the few visible items inside the thumbnaillist.
BR72347: (search doesn't work) Closeable NOW. The feature is already on HEAD.
BR72165: (showing a "scanned document PDF" is very slow). By running many tests
         on xpdf and kpdf_experiments, I measured 5-15% speed loss (due to
	 internal pixmap conversions). No noticeable difference.
BR89835: (PDF pages to be aligned centrally). Done in branch.
BR90026: (crash). Can't reproduce on branch.
