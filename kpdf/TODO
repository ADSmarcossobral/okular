Personal Albert's list
-> make links functional

More items
-> screen editing: framework
-> screen editing: tools

Porting / In progress
-> implementing Document / Page using AACid's thread as the generation thread
-> improve thumbnail generation to make it non-gui blocking
-> multiple pages per view
-> centering pages in the view
-> outline bottom and right edges (of pages)

Done
-> merge lots of kpdf_part and part (centralview) code (to simplify/clenup)
-> maybe: use local instead of X memory for thumbnails (..)
-> previews sorted by visible areas (prioritize items where the scrollbar is)
