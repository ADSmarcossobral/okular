Personal Albert's list
-> make links functional
-> Activate errors again having in mind a thread (thumbnail) can generate an error and that will make a kmessagbox appear and kill kpdf

More items
-> merge lots of kpdf_part and part (centralview) code (to simplify/clenup)
-> previews sorted by visible areas (prioritize items where the scrollbar is)
-> maybe: use local instead of X memory for thumbnails (..)
-> screen editing: framework
-> screen editing: tools
-> multiple pages per view
-> centering pages in the view
-> outline bottom and right edges (of pages)
