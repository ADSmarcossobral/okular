<P>Q: Why is kdvi not displaying anything but a busy cursor?<BR>
A: It is
possible, that kdvi is searching for the pk-fonts from wrong places,
and this can be very time consuming if these include network mounted
filesystems. You can check for this with strace and see below for a
cure.
<P>Q: What can I do when kdvi does not find my PK-fonts?<BR>
A: You must have correct settings for resolution and Metafont mode.<BR> 
If this does not help, you may set the field
'PK Font Path' in Preferences/Fonts to point to the  list of directories
to be searched for pk-fonts:<BR>
/var/lib/texmf/fonts/pk/ljfour/:/some/other/place<BR>
You can make kdvi search recursively by adding an extra / at the end of
directory name:<BR>
/var/lib/texmf/fonts//<BR>
(This works like xdvi's XDVIFONTS environment variable.
There is also good (gnu info) documentation available for the kpathsea library
that kdvi uses for font searching.)<BR>
This makes kdvi usable when you have some other tex system than tetex and don't
have the texmf.cnf file.
<P>Q: How do I get the font generation to work?<BR>
A: If you like to enable automatic font generation using MakeTeXPK,
you must also supply correct Metafont mode in preferences dialog.
When automatic pk-font generation is disabled (menu option)
the missing fonts will be logged to file missfont.log in the current directory.
It is a good idea to check that the font generation commands in
missfont.log are correct before enabling font generation.
