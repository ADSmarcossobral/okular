<P>The View menu offers entries to step through available magnifications:
Zoom in and Zoom out. The available magnifications corresponds to the
base resolution of the used pk-font and its reductions by integer
factors.
<P>The button bar presents these same commands plus two fixed
magnifications for quick selection. You can use these to switch
between a readable text size and a magnified view (there is no
separate magnifier window) or between a readable size and a full page
view. You can configure these fixed sizes with preferences dialog.
<P>One non-obvious feature is the selection of scaling center. You can
select with left mouse button the point on the page that does not move
(if possible) when changing the magnification. Use this by clicking
with left mouse button at the detail you want to see magnified and
then push the magnified view button.
